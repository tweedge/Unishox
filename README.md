# Unishox - Guaranteed Compression for Unicode Short Strings

This is a C library for compressing short strings.  It was developed to individually compress and decompress small strings. In general compression utilities such as `zip`, `gzip` do not compress short strings well and often expand them. They also use lots of memory which makes them unusable in constrained environments like Arduino.

Note: The present byte-code version is 2 and it replaces Unishox 1.  Unishox 1 is still available as unishox1.c, but it will have to be compiled manually if it is needed.

# Applications

- Compression for low memory devices such as Arduino and ESP8266
- Compression of Chat application text exchange include Emojis
- Storing compressed text in database
- Faster retrieval speed when used as join keys
- Bandwidth and storage cost reduction for Cloud

# How it works

Unishox is an hybrid encoder (entropy, dictionary and delta coding).  It works by assigning fixed prefix-free codes for each letter in the above Character Set (entropy coding).  It also encodes repeating letter sets separately (dictionary coding).  For Unicode characters, delta coding is used. More information is available in [this article](Unishox_Article_2.pdf?raw=true).

# Compiling

To compile, just use `make` or use gcc as follows:

```sh
gcc -o unishox2 test_unishox2.c unishox2.c
```

For testing the compiled program, use:

```sh
./test_unishox2 -t
```

# API

```C
int unishox2_compress_simple(const char *in, int len, char *out);
int unishox2_decompress_simple(const char *in, int len, char *out);
```

# Usage

To see Unishox in action, simply try to compress a string:

```
./test_unishox2 "Hello World"
```

To compress and decompress a file, use:

```
./test_unishox2 -c <input_file> <compressed_file>
./test_unishox2 -d <compressed_file> <decompressed_file>
```

Unishox does not give good ratios compressing large files or compressing binary files.

# Character Set

Unishox supports the entire Unicode character set.  As of now it supports UTF-8 as input and output encoding.
